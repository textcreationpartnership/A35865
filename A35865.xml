         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Health: but it ought to be every ones care to preſerve their Health; and if we were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep out Diſeaſes, we ſhould not be ſo troubled to drive them out. Reaſon tells us, that it is better to keep out an Enemy, then to let him in, and then to beat him out. So doubtleſſe, if men in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Health would uſe Reaſon more, they would need the Phyſician leſſe: For Intemperance, which is the great enemy of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is the chief Cauſe of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
<pb facs="tcp:105727:3"/>wherewith the bodies of men and women are afflicted; and they muſt needs act contrary to Reaſon, who do any thing that is contrary to the courſe of Nature; as to eat, or drink, or ſleep, or ſtir the body more then Nature requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or leſs then Nature requireth. The good old Phyſician <hi>Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſaith, That fulneſs or emptineſs, or any thing elſe which is otherwiſe then Nature would have it, ſhould be ſhunned as hurtful. For this is the thing that maketh work for the Phyſician; and he is more employed in helping the bad Effects of <hi>too much,</hi> then of <hi>too little;</hi> and the Cauſe of this is the abuſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; when we make it the work of our Reaſon to find out wayes of Intemperancy; and we make Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:105727:3"/>a Slave to Appetite: where as if we would live like Rational People, we ſhould rather imploy our Reaſon in obſerving our owne Nature, and obſerving what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it, and what is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it. And ſo we might by our own experience find out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which would make much both for the preſerving of our Health, and prolonging of our Life. Certainly, we might eaſily keep our ſelves in Health, if we were as careful to keep when we have it, as we are to regain it, when it is loſt: and it is a ſtrange over-ſight not to prize our Health until we are tormented with Diſeaſes; to throw away our Health unreaſonably or careleſly, and then to lament our loſs too late, and to be in long tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:105727:4"/>and at great charge before we can regain. Therefore thoſe who rightly prize their Health, which is indeed a great Treaſure, let them live temperately, obſerve diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own Natures, and follow exactly theſe Rules for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Health, which have been found out by the great induſtry, judicious inquiry, and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Learned Men: the which Rules you have ſet down here as followeth, in ſome few and plain Directions.</p>

It is a good rule of Diet, to eat often and little at a time, not to let the ſtomack be long empty, nor to eat again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be empty; for to eat or drink (when we have meat in our ſtomack half digeſted, or almoſt digeſted) before the digeſtion be finiſhed, it doth much diſturb the digeſtive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,

                  <p>As for Bread, we may very well give it the firſt place at meales, for it yeildeth a nouriſhment very familiar to our Natures.

               <p n="4">4. Thoſe who have ſlender and dry bodies, receive great benefit by ſleeping after dinner; for it moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their bodies, and refreſheth their ſpirits. But thoſe who have full groſs bodies, or who are of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine or phlegmatick complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them beware of ſleeping after dinner.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe who would ſleep at noon muſt obſerve theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they ſleep not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Dinner, but an hour after, or half an hour at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they ſleep not lying, but
<pb facs="tcp:105727:15"/>rather ſitting with the body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they-ſleep not over long, not above half an hour, or an hour at moſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they ſleep not in a place too hot (eſpecially in the Summer time) but rather enclining to cold: the moſt convenient place for any to ſleep in at any time, is that which is not too hot nor too cold, not too cloſe nor too open; and above all, it muſt not be dampiſh, for that is very hurtful to the body, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the head: you muſt have a care to keep your head and neck wel from the cold when you ſleep.</p>
               <p>When you ſleep, lye upon your right ſide; and not upon your left ſide, unleſſe it be to eaſe your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when you are wearied with ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon your right ſide: lye upon your left ſide as little as you can; for to lye upon the left ſide, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
<pb facs="tcp:105727:16"/>concoction, encreaſeth the Diſeaſes of the Spleene, cauſeth troubleſome Dreames, &amp;c. So likewiſe to lye upon your back when you ſleep, is very unwholſome; it cauſeth troubleſome ſleeps, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Night-mare, it occaſioneth the Lethargy, Palſies, Cramp, it heateth the Raines; it is very bad for thoſe who are troubled with the Stone, or are inclined to it.</p>
               <p>Now if you would know how long you ought to ſleep, obſerve this rule, That you ſhould ſleep, until you find the concoction of the ſtomack and liver be finiſhed, the ſpirits well refreſhed, and you find a lightſomneſſe in the whole body, eſpecially in the ſtomack and head. But if you find heavineſſe in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, head, and eyes, or ſtomack, or if you have ill ſavoured belchings, or &amp;c. they ſignifie that you have not yet ſlept enough.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105727:16"/>
               <p>Again, the time of your ſleep muſt be determined according to your ſtrength and conſtitution; as thoſe who are weak and ſickly, or aged and children, muſt take longer time of reſt, then thoſe who are ſtrong, or young, for whom ſeven or eight hours ſleep is enough. And thoſe who have dry, cholerick or melancholick bodies, need longer ſleep then the phlegmatick or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, or thoſe who have groſſe fat bodies; for it very much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and moiſtneth dry bodies, to whom there is nothing more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then too much watchfulneſs. But too long ſleep to phlegmatick, groſſe bodies is very hurtful.</p>
               <p>It is a cuſtome to warme the bed before we go to bed, which ſhould not be uſed by thoſe who are healthful and ſtrong (unleſſe freſh ſheets be layed upon the bed) for it weakneth their bodies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:105727:17"/>them tender. But it is good for them who are aged, or are weak by Nature, or lead a tender courſe of life, for ſuch cannot well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a cold bed, it may wrong them much: weak or tender Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are by very ſmall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons overcome and put out of their right courſes.</p>
               <p>I conclude concerning ſleeping and watching with this, That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and unſeaſonable Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakeneth the natural heat, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the body with bad humours, and enclineth the body to cold, phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Diſeaſes, dulleth the ſpirits and wit.</p>
               <p>And immoderate Watching dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the body too much, it turneth a ſanguine conſtitution to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick; and it turneth a phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick conſtitution to be melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it overdryeth the braine; it waſteth the ſpirits, it weakneth the

               <p>Thoſe who would uſe any kind of Exerciſe only for their Healths ſake, let them not do it upon a full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or immediately after eating, for the moſt part of Phyſicians do agree in this, that wee ſhould not go about any exerciſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy until the firſt and ſecond digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is compleated, when the ſtomack is light and almoſt empty.</p>

And if you uſe any exerciſe or violent motion of the body immediately after meales, or while there is meat in
<pb facs="tcp:105727:18"/>the ſtomack not digeſted, it marreth digeſtion, and cauſeth crudities and bad humours; whereupon will follow Scabs, Ulcers, Impoſthumes. This is to be underſtood chiefly of thoſe who uſe a reſtful life, and live tenderly. But thoſe who live in continual exerciſe of their body, as labouring men, they need not be ſo cautious for the time or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Exerciſe (for that to which our Natures are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſtomed, will not do us harme,) if men keep themſelves to one conſtant courſe of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and not at any time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their ordinary cuſtome: but if they do things raſhly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, otherwiſe then they uſe to do; as if they fall upon any work upon a full ſtomack; or if after violent hot working they are careleſſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and keep not themſelves

<pb facs="tcp:105727:19"/>hurtful; but to riſe up after meal, to ſtand or to walk ſoftly is good: and if it be in cold ſeaſons of the year, let the place be temperate, not too hot nor too cold; if it be in the hot ſeaſons of the year, walk in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fields, nigh to ſome pleaſant rivers after ſupper; but after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in ſome ſhadowed place, or ſome cool Arbour, &amp;c.

It ſtirreth up and encreaſeth natural heat, it quickneth the blood, it ſtrengthneth the parts, it drawes humours from the higher parts of the body to the lower parts, it concocteth crude humours, it ſtrengthneth digeſtion, it draweth bad humours from the principal parts of the body; there is not any one thing which may be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended then this, for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtrength of Nature. But as all other Exerciſes of the body, ſo rubbing of the body muſt be uſed with caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who have groſs or phlegmatick bodies muſt rub over their bodies until
<pb facs="tcp:105727:21"/>they provoke ſweat; but thoſe who have hot bodies, or dry ſlender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they muſt rub their bodies until the fleſh beginneth to ſwell, and groweth ruddiſh, and no longer. So likewiſe according to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt uſe rubbing more or leſſe; as the ſeaſon is colder, ſo muſt we uſe rubbing more, and leſs in hot ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>The manner how it is to be done, is thus. Rub with your hands, or rather with a warme linnen cloth your ſhoulders, armes, breaſt, ſides, thighes, Legs and feet; but the belly, ſtomack and back, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially neer to the reines muſt not be rubbed. If you can your ſelves do it, and not to have another to do it, it will be ſo a great deal better. You muſt do it when you lye downe at night, but then more gently; but in the morning before you riſe do it more ſtrongly; and when you
<pb facs="tcp:105727:22"/>riſe, have a care to keep your ſelves well from the cold. Begin your rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing eaſily and ſoftly, afterwards faſter and harder; and while you are rubbing, lay a double cloth warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your ſtomack and belly. After you are riſen, and have combed your head well backward, then rub your head and your neck with a warm linnen cloth, and (if it be a cold ſeaſon) before the fire, remembring the Cautions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rubbing before mentioned. This rubbing of the Head and Neck, is eſpecially to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thoſe who have moiſt heads, Students, and ſuch as are troubled with Rhumes, Palſies, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>Of Excrements.</head>
               <p n="1">1. To go to ſtool twice or once in the day at leaſt, preventeth thoſe many inconveniences which are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the too long ſtay of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements in the body; but if you cannot do ſo by reaſon of coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is very hurtful, and hath many inconveniencies following it, therefore drink much, eſpecially at meals, that thereby the ſtomack and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtines may be well moiſtned: this will keep the Excrements ſoft, and make the paſſages ſlippery. But if Nature is dull and ſlow to evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be good to uſe ſome gentle looſening thing, at firſt once in two dayes for ſome time, then uſe it once in a day: and when you
<pb facs="tcp:105727:23"/>have accuſtomed your ſelf to go to ſtool ſo once in the day, Nature it ſelfe will afterwards obſerve that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sweating is very good for groſs phlegmatick Bodies; but thoſe who have dry ſlender bodies, muſt uſe it very moderately; and thoſe whoſe bodies are too much drved by a Diſeaſe, or are enclining to a Conſumption muſt eſchew ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as much as they can.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Keep not Urine or Wind in your body, when Nature would void them, for they are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if they be kept long in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if you cannot break wind upward when it is in the ſtomack, or break it downward when it is in the belly, then uſe ſomething which is good againſt the wind: let it ſtay in your body as little time as you can, eſpecially if it be bred (as moſt commonly it is) of Crudities;
<pb facs="tcp:105727:23"/>but when your body is free from Crudities, do not accuſtome your ſelfe to break wind, refraine from it then as much as you can; for if we bring Nature to a cuſtome to break wind much, it is the way to make it breed wind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To uſe any thing to provoke the evacuation of phlegme at the mouth or noſe, is not to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of; it is beſt to let Nature follow its own courſe, unleſſe thoſe Excrements of the mouth or noſe be obſtructed: or abound exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of a cold, or ſome other Cauſe.
